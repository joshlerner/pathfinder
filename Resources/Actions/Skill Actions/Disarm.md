# Disarm `pf2:1`

==[[Attack]]==

**Requirements** You have at least one hand free. The target can't be more than one size larger than you.
___
You try to knock an item out of a creature's grasp. Attempt an [[Athletics]] check against the target's Reflex DC.

**Critical Success** You knock the item out of the target's grasp. It falls to the ground in the target's space.
**Success** You weaken your target's grasp on the item. Further attempts to Disarm the target of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item. The creature can end the effect by Interacting to change its grip on the item; otherwise, it lasts as long as the creature hold the item.
**Critical Failure** You lose your balance and become [[off-guard]] until the start of your next turn.
