# Learn a Spell

==[[Concentrate]]== ==[[Exploration]]==

**Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition's spell list.
___
You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions but you must use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were a [[Resources/Reference/Traits/Cleric]] with the [[bard mulitclass]] archetype, you couldn't use [Religion] to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire.

To learn the spell, you must do the following:
- Spend 1 hour per spell rank, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
- Have materials with the Price indicated in the Learning a Spell table.
- Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition.

**Critical Success** You spend half the materials and learn the spell.
**Success** You expend the materials and learn the spell.
**Failure** You fail to learn the spell but can try again after you gain a level. The materials aren't expended.
**Critical Failure** As failure, except you expend half the materials.

| Spell Level | Price | Typical DC |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1st | 2 gp | 15 |
| 2nd | 6 gp | 18 |
| 3rd | 16 gp | 20 |
| 4th | 36 gp | 23 |
| 5th | 70 gp | 26 |
| 6th | 140 gp | 28 |
| 7th | 300 gp | 31 |
| 8th | 650 gp | 34 |
| 9th | 1,500 gp | 36 |
| 10th | 7,000 gp | 41 |

A spell you learn is added to your repository of spells, such as a spellbook for a wizard, familiar for a witch, or spell list for a cleric or druid. If you have a spell repertoire, such as a bard, it's not automatically added since you can only know a limited number of spells. Instead, you can select it when you add or swap spells.
