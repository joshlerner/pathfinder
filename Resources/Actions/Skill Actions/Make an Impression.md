___
With at least 1 minute of conversation, during which you engage in charismatic overtures, flattery, and other acts of goodwill, you seek to make a good impression on someone to make them temporarily agreeable. At the end of the conversation, attempt a [[Diplomacy]] check against the Will DC of one target. You can instead choose up to five targets if you take a -2 penalty. The GM might add other bonuses or penalties based on the situation. Any impression you make lasts for only the current social interaction unless the GM decides otherwise.

**Critical Success** The target's attitude toward you improves by two steps.
**Success** The target's attitude toward you improves by one step.
