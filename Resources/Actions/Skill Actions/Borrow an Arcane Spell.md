# Borrow an Arcane Spell

==[[Concentrate]]== ==[[Exploration]]==
___
If you're an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells, you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else's arcane spellbook, arcane witch familiar, or the like. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell's rank and rarity; it's typically a bit easier than [[Learn a Spell|Learning the Spell]].

**Success** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.
**Failure** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can't try to borrow this spell again until the next time you prepare spells.
