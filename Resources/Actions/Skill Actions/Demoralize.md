==[[Auditory]]== ==[[Concentrate]]== ==[[Emotion]]== ==[[Fear]]== ==[[Mental]]==
___
With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting put-down, you can shake an enemy's resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you're aware of. Attempt an [[Intimidation]] check against that target's Will DC. If the target doesn't understand the language you are speaking, or you're not speaking a language, you take a -4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10 minutes.

**Critical Success** The target becomes [[Frightened|frightened 2]].
**Success** The target becomes frightened 1.
