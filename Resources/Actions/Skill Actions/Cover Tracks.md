# Cover Tracks

==[[Concentrate]]== ==[[Exploration]]== ==[[Move]]==
___
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed. You don't need to attempt a [[Survival]] check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.

In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn't have the exploration trait.
