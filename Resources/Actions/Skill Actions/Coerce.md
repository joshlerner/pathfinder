___
With threats either veiled or overt, you attempt to bully a creature into doing what you want. You must spend at least 1 minute of conversation with the creature. At the end of the conversation, attempt an [[Intimidation]] check against the target's Will DC, modified by any circumstances the GM determines.

**Critical Success** The target gives you the information you seek or agrees to follow your directives so long as they aren't likely to harm the target in any way. The target continues to comply for an amount of time determined by the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at which point the target becomes [[unfriendly]]. However, the target is too scared of you to retaliate—at least in the short term.
**Success** As critical success, but once the target becomes unfriendly, they might decide to act against you—for example, by reporting you to the authorities or assisting your enemies.
**Failure** The target doesn't do what you say, and if they were not already unfriendly or hostile, they become unfriendly.
**Critical Failure** The target refuses to comply, becomes hostile if they weren't already, and is temporarily immune to your Coercion for at least 1 week.
