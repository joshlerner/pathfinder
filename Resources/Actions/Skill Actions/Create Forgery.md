# Create Forgery

==[[Downtime]]== ==[[Secret]]==

**Requirements** You provide the proper writing materials for your forgery.
___
You create a forged document, usually over the course of a day or week. The GM rolls a secret DC 20 [[Society]] check. If you need to forge a specific person's handwriting, you need a sample of that person's handwriting. Otherwise, you need only to have seen a similar document, and you gain yup to a +4 circumstance bonus to the check.

**Success** The forgery is of good enough quality that passive observers can't notice the fake.
**Failure** The forgery has some obvious signs of being fake, potentially allowing passive observers to detect it. Each time a passive observer sees the document, the GM compares your check result to the observer's Perception DC or Society DC, whichever is higher. If our result doesn't exceed a passive observer's DC, that observer knows the document is a forgery.
