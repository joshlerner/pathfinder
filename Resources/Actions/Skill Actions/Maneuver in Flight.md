# Maneuver in Flight   `pf2:1`

==[[Move]]==

**Requirements** You have a fly Speed.
___
You try a difficult maneuver while flying. Attempt an [[Acrobatics]] check. The GM determines what maneuvers are possible, but they rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.

**Success** You succeed at the maneuver.
**Failure** Your maneuver fails. The GM chooses if you simply can't move or if some other detrimental effect happens. The outcome should be appropriate for the maneuver you attempted.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the consequence is more dire.
