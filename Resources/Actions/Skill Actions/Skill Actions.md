# Skill Actions

The actions you can perform with a given skill are sorted into those you can use untrained and those that require you to be trained in the skill. Anyone can use a skill's untrained actions, but you can use trained actions only if you have a proficiency rank of trained or better in that skill. A circumstance, condition, or effect might bar you from a skill action regardless of your proficiency rank, and sometimes using a skill in a specific situation might require you to have a higher proficiency rank than what is listed on the table. For instance, even though a fighter untrained in Arcana could identify a construct with a lucky roll using [[Arcana]] to [[Recall Knowledge]], the GM might decide that Recalling Knowledge to determine the spells used to create such a construct is beyond the scope of the fighter's anecdotal knowledge. The GM decides whether a task requires a particular proficiency rank.
