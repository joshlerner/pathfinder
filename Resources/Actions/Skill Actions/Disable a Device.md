# Disable a Device `pf2:2`

==[[Manipulate]]==
___
This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. A thieves' toolkit is helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in [[Thievery]] to disable it.  
  
Your Thievery check result determines your progress.  

**Critical Success** You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a device requiring more than one success. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.  
**Success** You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a device that requires more than one success.  
**Critical Failure** You trigger the device.
