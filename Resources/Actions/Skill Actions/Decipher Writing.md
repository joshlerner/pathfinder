# Decipher Writing

==[[Concentrate]]== ==[[Exploration]]== ==[[Secret]]==
___
You attempt to decipher complicated writing or literature on an obscure topic. This usually takes a minute per page of text, but might take longer. The text must be in a language you can read, thought eh GM might allow you to attempt to decipher text written in an unfamiliar language using [[Society]] instead.

The DC is determined by the GM based on the state or complexity of the document. The GM might have you roll one check for a short text or a check for each section of a larger text.

**Critical Success** You understand the tru meaning of the text.
**Success** You understand the true meaning of the text. If it was a coded document, you know the general meaning but might not have a word-for-word translation.
**Failure** You can't understand the text and take a -2 circumstance penalty to further checks to decipher it.
**Critical Failure** You believe you understand the text on that page, but you have in fact misconstrued its message.
