# Force Open `pf2:1`

==[[Attack]]==
___
Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate. With a high enough result, you can even smash through walls. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a -2 item penalty to the [[Athletics]] check to Force Open.

**Critical Success** You open the door, window, container, or gate and can avoid damaging it in the process.
**Success** You break the door, window container, or gate open, and it gains the [[broken]] condition. If it's especially sturdy, the GM might have it take damage but not be broken.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt jams the door, window, container, or gate shut, imposing a -2 circumstance penalty on future attempts to Force it Open.
