# Point Out `pf2:1`

==[[Auditory]]== ==[[Manipulate]]== ==[[Visual]]==

**Requirements** A creature is [[undetected]] by one or more of your allies but isn't undetected by you.
___
You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. That creature is [[hidden]] to your allies, rather than undetected. This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target. If your allies can't hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature's [[Stealth]] DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.
