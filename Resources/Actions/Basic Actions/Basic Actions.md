# Basic Actions

Basic actions represent common tasks like moving around, attacking, and helping others. As such, every creature can use basic actions except in some extreme circumstances, and many of those actions are used very frequently. Most notably you'll use [[Interact]], [[Step]], [[Stride]], and [[Strike]] a great deal. Many feats and other actions call upon you to use one of these basic actions or modify them to produces different effects. For example, a more complex action might let you Stride twice, and a large number of activities include a Strike. An action or activity might also modify a basic action, such as having you Stride up to half your Speed.
