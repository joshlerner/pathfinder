# Activate an Item

**Requirements** You can Activate an Item with the invested trait only if it's invested by you. If the item requires you to Interact with it, you must be wielding it or touching it with a free hand.
___
You call forth the effect of an item by properly activating it. This is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions, as listed in the item's stat block.

Some items can be activated as a reaction or free action. In this case, you Activate the Item as a reaction or free action instead of as an activity.  Such cases are noted in the item's Activate entry in its stat block—for example, "**Activate** `pf2:r` command."

**Long Activation Times** Some items take minutes or hours to activate. The Activate an Item activity for these items includes a mix of the listed activation components, but it's not necessary to break down which one you're providing at a given time. You can't use other actions or reactions while activating such an item, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these activations have the exploration trait, and you can't activate them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're activating one, your activation is disrupted.

**Activation Components** Each activation entry lists any components involved in the activation after the action icons or text, such as "**Activate** `pf2:1`&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  command." The activation components, described below, add traits and requirements to the activation. If you can't provide the components, you fail to Activate the Item.
- Command ([[auditory]], [[concentrate]])
- Envision ([[concentrate]])
- Interact ([[manipulate]])
- Cast a Spell
