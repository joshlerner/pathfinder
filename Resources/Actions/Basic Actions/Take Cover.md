# Take Cover `pf2:1`

**Requirements** You are benefiting from cover, are near a feature that allows you to take cover, or are [[prone]].
___
You press yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle to take better advantage of cover. If you would have standard cover, you instead gain greater cover, which provides a +4 circumstance bonus to AC, to Reflex saves against area effects, and to [[Stealth]] checks to [[Hide]], [[Sneak]], or otherwise avoid detection. Otherwise, you gain teh benefits of standard cover. This lasts until you move from your current space, use an [[attack]] action, becomes [[unconscious]], or end this effect as a free action.
