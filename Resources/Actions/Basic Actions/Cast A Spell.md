# Cast a Spell

___
Spells can vary in how many actions they take, as shown in the spell's stat block. You cast cantrips, spells from spell slots, and focus spells using the same process, but must expend the spell when casting a spell fro a spell slot and must spend 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. Some rules will refer to the Cast a Spell activity, such as "if the next action you use is to Cast a Spell." Any spell qualifies as a Cast a Spell activity and any characteristics of the spell use those of the specific spell you're casting.
