# Overclock Gear `pf2:1`

==[[Concentrate]]== ==[[Technomancer]]==

**Requirements** Your most recent action this turn was to cast a non-cantrip spell.
___
You siphon residual magic energy to unlock the full potential of your equipment. After Casting a Spell, one item you hold, wield, or wear, or a tech minion you are commanding (depending on your programming language), becomes overclocked for 1 minute. You can only have one overclocked gear at a time; if you attempt to overclock a different piece of gear, any other gear you have overclocked is no longer overclocked. As long as your gear is overclocked, you gain the benefits of you programming language's overclock boost.
