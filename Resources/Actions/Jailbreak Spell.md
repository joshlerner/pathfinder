# Jailbreak Spell`pf2:0`

==[[Concentrate]]== ==[[Technomancer]]==

**Requirements** Your gear is overclocked.
___
You draw the magical energy out of your overclocked gear to power a spellshape. You can apply a technomancer spellshape to the effects of the next spell you cast this turn without spending an extra action, and can choose to apply the jailbroken benefits of that spellshape to the spell. Each programming language has an additional jailbreak bonus applied to a specific spellshape feat. After you cast the jailbroken spell, your gear is no longer overclocked. You must still spend a Focus Point if you use Jailbreak Spell to cast a magic hack with the spellshape trait.
