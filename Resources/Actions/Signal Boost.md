___
You can extend the reach of your magic. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend the range to 30 feet.
	**Jailbreak** If you use Jailbreak Spell to use this spellshape, you increase the spell's range by 60 feet.
