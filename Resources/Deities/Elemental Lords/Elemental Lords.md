# Elemental Lords

Born amid the primal chaos of the multiverse's earliest days, the twelve elemental lords are divine embodiments of the Inner Spheres' raw elemental forces. With two lords of air, two of earth, two of wood, two of metal, two of fire, and two of water, half their number represent the aspects of each element that mortals consider benevolent, while the others represent the malicious and destructive aspects of those same elements. When the [[Material Plane]] was born, the benevolent elemental lords seeded it with all the potential of their elements, creating planets, stars, oceans, and life. Yet as mortality evolved, it began harnessing the elements for malevolent purposes, causing anguished dissent between the benevolent elemental lords and emboldening their evil counterparts.
