# Deities

- Deities are immortal in the outer planes. They can be trapped, but not killed. 
- Deities are mortal in the inner planes and significantly weakened, however, they can directly interact with the inner planes in this way
- Deities can not interact directly with the inner planes while in the outer planes.

History
- First the Maelstrom, no deities and no planes, only chaos
- Then, structure forms: early concepts of order and chaos 
	- Axeos, Azeus, Oksios, Otheos
	- In the first thought of existence, pharasma is born
- Pockets of order create the first axiomites, those that ventured into the maelstrom became the first proteans
- Axeos gathered the maelstrom and from pure chaos created the elemental planes, the lords of the planes (not yet split) and at their center a fraction of his divinity: the universe (now the first world) which after the divinity fractured into the eldest, pharasma stretched the overlapping creations forge, first world, universe, netherworld, and void.
- The remainder of axeos splits into asmodeus, sarenrae, zon-kuthon, etc




- Currently: Civilization and "taming" of the natural world has stretched the natural order thin, allowing Lamashtu the opportunity to slip in with corruption...an attempt was stopped many years ago but they are trying once again, meanwhile, tension between abadar and erastil grows

- Lamashtu's agents capture a servant of shelyn, a dapsara who was particularly interested in the mortal plane, was the patron of many and often visited the dreams of people...this is how she accessed ashenra.
