# Friendly

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects can impose this condition on a PC. A creature that is friendly to a character likes that character. It is likely to agree to [[Request|Requests]] from that character as long as they are simple, safe, and don't cont too much to fulfill. If the character uses hostile actions against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severing of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.
