# Prone

You're lying on the ground. You are [[off-guard]] and take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only [[move]] actions you can use while you're prone are [[Crawl]] and [[Stand]]. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can [[Take Cover]] while prone to hunker down and gain greater cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, which grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks.

If you would be knocked prone while you're [[Climbing]] or [[Flying]], your fall. you can't be knocked prone when [[Swimming]].
