# Conditions

While adventuring, characters (and sometimes their belongings) are affected by abilities and effects that apply conditions. For example, a spell or magic item might turn you invisible or cause you to be gripped by fear. Conditions change your state of being in some way, and they represent everything from the attitude other creatures have toward you and how they interact with you to what happens when a creature drains your blood or life essence.


## Groups of Conditions

Some conditions exist relative to one another or share a similar theme. It can be useful to look at these conditions together, rather than viewing them in isolation to understand how they interact.

**Attitudes**: [[Friendly]], [[Helpful]], [[Hostile]], [[Indifferent]], [[Unfriendly]]
**Death and Dying**: [[Doomed]], [[Dying]], [[Unconscious]], [[Wounded]]
**Degrees of Detection**: [[Hidden]], [[Observed]], [[Undetected]], [[Unnoticed]]
**Lowered Abilities**: [[Clumsy]], [[Drained]], [[Enfeebled]], [[Stupefied]]
**Senses**: [[Blinded]], [[Concealed]], [[Dazzled]], [[Deafened]], [[Invisible]]
