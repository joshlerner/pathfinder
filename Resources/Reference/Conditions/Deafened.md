# Deafened

You can't hear. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to hear. You take a -2 status penalty to Perception checks for initiative and checks that involve sound but also relay on other senses. If you perform an action that has the [[auditory]] trait, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost; attempt the check after spending the action but before any effects are applied. You are immune to auditory effects while deafened.
