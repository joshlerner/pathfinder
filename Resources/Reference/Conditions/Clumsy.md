# Clumsy

Your movements become clumsy and inexact. Clumsy always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Dexterity-based checks and DCs, including AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, and skill checks using [[Acrobatics]], [[Stealth]], and [[Resources/Reference/Skills/Thievery]].
