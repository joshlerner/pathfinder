# Fascinated

You're compelled to focus your attention on something, distracting you from whatever else is going on around you. You take a -2 status penalty to Perception and skill checks, and you can't use [[concentrate]] actions unless they are related to the subject of your fascination, as determined by the GM. For instance, you might be able to [[Seek]] and [[Recall Knowledge]] about the subject, but you likely couldn't cast a spell targeting a different creature. This condition ends if a creature uses hostile actions against you or any of your allies.
