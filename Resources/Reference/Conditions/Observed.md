# Observed

Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measure. to avoid detection, such as by using [[Stealth]] to [[Hide]], it can become [[hidden]] or [[undetected]] instead of observed. If you have another precise sense besides sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature with only your precise senses. When [[Seek|Seeking]] a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than observed.
