# Persistent Damage

You are taking damage from an ongoing effect, such as from being lit on fire. This appears as "X persistent (type) damage," where "X" is the amount of damage dealt and "(type)" is teh damage type. Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw. Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage dice each time. After you take persistent damage, roll a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends.

> [!special] Persistent Damage Rules
> Persistent damage runs its course and automatically ends after a certain amount of time as fire burns out, blood clots, and the like. The GM determines when this occurs, but it usually takes 1 minute.

> ## Assisted Recovery
>
> You can take steps to help yourself recover from persistent damage, or an ally can help you , allowing you to attempt an additional flat check before the end of your turn. This is usually an activity requiring 2 actions, and it must be something that would reasonably improve your chances. For example, you might try to smother a flame or wash off acid. This allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately, but only once per round.

> ## Multiple Persistent Damage Conditions
>
> You can be simultaneously affected by multiple persistent damage conditions so long as they have different damage types. If you would gain more than one persistent damage condition with the same damage type, the higher amount of damage overrides the lower amount. If it's unclear which damage would be higher, such as if you're already taking 2 persistent fire damage and then begin taking 1d4 persistent fire damage, the GM decides which source of damage would better fit the scene. The damage you take from persistent damage occurs all at once, so if something triggers when you take damage, it triggers only once; for example, if you're dying with several types of persistent damage, the persistent damage increases your dying condition only once.
