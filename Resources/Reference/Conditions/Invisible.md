# Invisible

You can't be seen. You're [[undetected]] to everyone. Creatures can [[Seek]] to detect you; if a creature succeeds at its Perception check against your [[Stealth]] DC, you becomes [[hidden]] to that creature until you [[Sneak]] to become undetected again. If you becomes invisible while someone can already see you, you start out hidden to them until you successfully Sneak. You can't become [[observed]] while invisible except via specific abilities or magic.
