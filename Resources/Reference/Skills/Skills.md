# Skills

While your character's attributes represent their raw talent and potential, skills represent their training and experience at performing certain tasks. Each skill is keyed to one of your character's attributes and used for an array of related actions. Your character's expertise in a skill comes from several sources, including their background and class.

A character's acumen in skills can come from all sorts of training, from practicing acrobatic tricks to studying academic topics to rehearsing a performing art. When you create your character and as they advance in level, you have flexibility as to which skills they become better at and when. Some classes depend heavily on certain skills—such as the [[Resources/Reference/Traits/Bard|bard's]] reliance on [[Performance]]—but for most classes, you can choose whichever skills make the most sense for your character's theme and backstory at 1st level, then use their adventure and downtime experiences to inform how their skills should improve as your character levels up.

A character gains training in certain skills at 1st level: typically two from their background, a small number of predetermined skills from their class, and several skills of your choice granted by their class. This training increases your proficiency ranks for those skills to trained instead of untrained and lets you use more of the skills' actions. Sometimes you might become trained in the same skill from multiple sources, such as if your background granted training in [[Survival]] and you took the ranger class, which also grants training in [[Survival]]. Each time after the first that you'd become trained in a given skill, you instead allocate the trained proficiency to any other skill of your choice—though if the skill is a [[Lore]] skill, the new skill must also be a [[Lore]] skill.

## Key Attribute

Each skill is tied to a key attribute. You add your modifier for this attribute to checks and DCs when using that skill. For example, skulking about the shadows of a city at night with [[Stealth]] uses your Dexterity modifier, navigating the myriad personalities and power plays of court politics with Society uses your Intelligence modifier, and so on. If the GM deems it appropriate for a certain situation, however, they might have you use a different attribute modifier for a skill check or when determining your skill DC.

## Skill Checks and DCs

When you're actively using a skill, often by performing one of its actions, you might attempt a skill check: rolling a d20 and adding your skill modifier. To determine this modifier, add your attribute modifier for the skill's key attribute, your proficiency bonus for the skill, and any other bonuses and penalties.

**<center>Skill modifier = key attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses/penalties</center>**

When noting the modifier on your character sheet, you should write down only the numbers that always apply— typically just your attribute modifier and proficiency bonus at 1st level. At higher levels, you may wear or use items to improve your skills with item bonuses pretty much all the time; you should include those in your calculation, too.  
  
The GM sets the DC of a skill check, using the [GM Core guidelines](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2627) . The DCs you're most likely to encounter frequently are the five simple skill DCs below, which are presented here to give you a sense of what number you'll need to roll to succeed at most tasks.

| Task Difficulty | Simple DC |
| :--: | :--: |
| Untrained | 10 |
| Trained | 15 |
| Expert | 20 |
| Master | 30 |
| Legendary | 40 |

When someone or something tests your skill, they attempt a check against your skill DC, which is equal to 10 plus your skill modifier. A skill DC works like any other DC to determine the effect of an opposing creature's skill action.
