# Performance (Cha)

You are skilled at a form of performance, using your talents to impress a crowd or make a living.

## Basic Competence

Some performances require you to be more than just charismatic, and if you don't meet the demands of the art form of the audience, the GM might apply a penalty based on the relevant attribute. For example, if you're dancing and have a negative Dexterity modifier, you might take a penalty to your attempt at dancing. Likewise, if you are orating and have a negative Intelligence modifier, you might have to hope raw Charisma can overcome the penalties from your intellectual shortcomings—or ask someone to help write you speeches!

## Performance Traits

When you use an action that utilizes the Performance skill, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of performance. The GM might change these depending on the circumstances , but the most common performance-based traits are listed below.

| Performance | Additional Traits |
| :--: | :--: |
| Act or perform comedy | [[auditory]], [[linguistic]], and [[visual]]|
| Dance | [[move]] and [[visual]] |
| Play an instrument | [[auditory]] and [[manipulate]] |
| Orate or sing | [[auditory]] and [[linguistic]] |

If you want to be particularly skilled with one type of performance, you can select the [[Virtuosic Performer]] skill feat. That feat breaks down some of the performance listed above into specific instrument types, and your GM might allow you to add your own type.
