# Athletics (Str)

Athletics allows you to perform deeds of physical prowess. Most Athletics actions let you move about the environment ([[Climb]], [[High Jump]], [[Long Jump]], [[Swim]]) or control your opponent's movement in combat ([[Resources/Actions/Skill Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Reposition]], [[Resources/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]], [[Resources/Actions/Skill Actions/Trip|Trip]], and [[Resources/Actions/Skill Actions/Disarm|Disarm]]). When you youse the [[Escape]] basic action, you can use your Athletics modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier.
